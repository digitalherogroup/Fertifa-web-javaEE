                <p>
                    18.1 If you have a complaint or disagree with us about anything to do with these Terms please contact us
                    as set out in clause 4.
                </p>

                <p>
                    18.2 We may ask you for certain details about you and your complaint in order to address it. Please
                    provide these as soon as you can so that we can resolve your complaint quickly. We will investigate any
                    complaints and then let you know of the outcome of such investigation. We prefer to settle complaints
                    quickly and amicably and so, if our investigation shows that something went wrong, we shall discuss how we
                    propose to fix it with you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    19.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation. We will always
                    tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under
                    the contract.
                </p>

                <p>
                    19.2 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersede all other
                    agreements, statements, letters and other arrangements between the parties in relation to the subject
                    matter hereof. Each party acknowledges that it has not relied on or been induced to enter this Agreement
                    by a representation other than those expressly set out in this Agreement. This clause does not affect a
                    party&rsquo;s liability in respect of a fraudulent misrepresentation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    19.3 This Agreement is personal to you. You may not transfer your rights or your obligations under these
                    terms to another person.
                </p>

                <p>
                    19.4 This Agreement does not give rise to any rights under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
                    1999 to enforce any term of this Agreement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    19.5 Each clause of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any
                    of them are unlawful, the remaining clauses will remain in full force and effect. The headings of clauses
                    in these Terms are for explanation only and are not part of this contract.
                </p>

                <p>
                    19.6 Even if we delay in enforcing this Agreement, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist
                    immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps
                    against you in respect of your breaking this Agreement, that will not mean that you do not have to do
                    those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
                </p>

                <p>
                    19.7 This Agreement is governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in the English
                    courts.&nbsp; If you are a consumer resident outside England and Wales you may issue proceedings against
                    us under or in relation to these Terms in your local courts.
